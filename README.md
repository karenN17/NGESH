# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with style and a touch of humor. 😎

## Features ✨

- ➕ **Addition**: Adds two numbers like a pro!
- ➖ **Subtraction**: Finds the difference (even if it's negative vibes).
- ✖️ **Multiplication**: Gives you more bang for your buck!
- ➗ **Division**: Splits numbers up (but watch out for zero! 🚨).

## How to Use 🚀

1. Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Enjoy the magic as the calculator displays:
   - Sum
   - Difference
   - Product
   - Quotient

## Example Input/Output 📊

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Important Notes ⚠️

- The calculator uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers.
- Division by zero will cause an error (because math says no! ❌).

## Future Improvements 🔮

- [ ] Add error handling for division by zero.
- [ ] Include more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.).
- [ ] Make it a GUI application for extra fun! 🖥️
